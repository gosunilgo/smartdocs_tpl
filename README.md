# smartdocs_tpl

This is an Apigee SmartDocs sample template for use on Apigee Drupal developer portal.

The initial commit is from Anil's Sagar's [article on the Apigee Community site called *Apigee Developer Portal - Custom - SmartDocs Template - Request Body Parameters - SDCT002*](https://community.apigee.com/articles/48875/apigee-developer-portal-custom-smartdocs-template-1.html)

The purpose here is 
1. to improve the template and work out any issues
2. share forks (hopefully well documented) to share ideas about best presentation for SmartDocs.
